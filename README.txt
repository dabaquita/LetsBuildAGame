Purpose: Learn about setting up a Java game
         and learn about the concepts of game
         design.

========================================

Update: Done after Tutorial #10. Learned enough
        about the basics. Now onto making
        my own product, and possibly implementing
        the next videos' concepts into actually
        helping me achieve my own product.
